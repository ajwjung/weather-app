# Weather App

## Objective

To create a weather forecast site using [OpenWeatherMap's API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to practice working with promises and APIs. Full details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app).

**Requirements**

1. Include a simple form that allows the user to enter a location

2. Use the weather API to fetch weather data for the location, then display the data on the page

3. Have a feature that toggles the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius

4. Change the look of the page based on the data (e.g., change the background or add images that describe the weather)

**Optional**

- Add a 'loading' component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API
